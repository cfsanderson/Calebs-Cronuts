# The Donut Experiment

This is a mockup based on [The Donut Experiment's website](http://thedonutexperiment.com/). It's a favorite Saturday morning destination for my family and I.

I built this site as one of the course requirements at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/). The main objectives were to build the site using React and more specifically to utilize React Router to manage site navigation.
