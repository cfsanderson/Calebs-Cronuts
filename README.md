This is a restaurant mockup based on [The Donut Experiment's website](http://thedonutexperiment.com/) and my favorite pastry ever, the cronut. The Donut Experiment is a favorite Saturday morning destination for my family so I reimagined it as my Cronut shop (with a nod to the biggest chain donut shop ;).

I built this site as one of the course requirements at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/). The main objectives were to use React (more specifically to utilize React Router) to manage site navigation, make API calls to GitHub (avatar and bio info on Contact page) and Google Maps (for Location data), and style in a cohesive manner.
